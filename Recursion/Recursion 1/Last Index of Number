Last Index of Number
Send Feedback
Given an array of length N and an integer x, you need to find and return the last index of integer x present in the array. Return -1 if it is not present in the array.
Last index means - if x is present multiple times in the array, return the index at which x comes last in the array.
You should start traversing your array from 0, not from (N - 1).
Do this recursively. Indexing in the array starts from 0.
Input Format :
Line 1 : An Integer N i.e. size of array
Line 2 : N integers which are elements of the array, separated by spaces
Line 3 : Integer x
Output Format :
last index or -1
Constraints :
1 <= N <= 10^3
Sample Input :
4
9 8 10 8
8
Sample Output :
3

public class Solution {

	public static int lastIndex(int input[], int x) {
		/* Your class should be named Solution
		 * Don't write main().
		 * Don't read input, it is passed as function argument.
		 * Return output and don't print it.
	 	 * Taking input and printing output is handled automatically.

        return helper(input.length-1,x,input);
	}
    
    private static int helper(int i,int x,int [] arr){
        
        if(i==-1)
            return -1;
        
        if(arr[i]==x)
            return i;
        
        return helper(i-1,x,arr);
    }

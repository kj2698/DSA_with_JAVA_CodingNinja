First Index of Number
Send Feedback
Given an array of length N and an integer x, you need to find and return the first index of integer x present in the array. Return -1 if it is not present in the array.
First index means, the index of first occurrence of x in the input array.
Do this recursively. Indexing in the array starts from 0.
Input Format :
Line 1 : An Integer N i.e. size of array
Line 2 : N integers which are elements of the array, separated by spaces
Line 3 : Integer x
Output Format :
first index or -1
Constraints :
1 <= N <= 10^3
Sample Input :
4
9 8 10 8
8
Sample Output :
1

public class Solution {

	public static int firstIndex(int input[], int x) {
		/* Your class should be named Solution
		 * Don't write main().
		 * Don't read input, it is passed as function argument.
		 * Return output and don't print it.
	 	 * Taking input and printing output is handled automatically.

        return helper(0,x,input);
	}
	
    
    private static int helper(int i,int x,int [] arr){
        
        if(i==arr.length)
            return -1;
        
        if(arr[i]==x)
            return i;
        
        return helper(i+1,x,arr);
    }
}

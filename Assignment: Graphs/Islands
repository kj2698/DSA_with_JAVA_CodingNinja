Islands
Send Feedback
An island is a small piece of land surrounded by water . A group of islands is said to be connected if we can reach from any given island to any other island in the same group . Given V islands (numbered from 0 to V-1) and E connections or edges between islands. Can you count the number of connected groups of islands.
Input Format :
The first line of input contains two integers, that denote the value of V and E.
Each of the following E lines contains two integers, that denote that there exists an edge between vertex a and b. 
Output Format :
Print the count the number of connected groups of islands
Constraints :
0 <= V <= 1000
0 <= E <= (V * (V-1)) / 2
0 <= a <= V - 1
0 <= b <= V - 1
Time Limit: 1 second
Sample Input 1:
5 8
0 1
0 4
1 2
2 0
2 4
3 0
3 2
4 3
Sample Output 1:

	public static String findWinner(int n, int x, int y) {
		//Your code goes here
       int [] win=new int[n+1];
        int max=Math.max(1,Math.max(x,y));
        for (int i = 0; i <=max ; i++) {
            win[i]=1;
        }
        for (int i = max+1; i <=n ; i++) {
            int v1=(win[i-1]+1)%2;
            int v2=(win[i-x]+1)%2;
            int v3=(win[i-y]+1)%2;
            win[i]=v1|v2|v3;
        }
        if (win[n]==1)
            return "Beerus";

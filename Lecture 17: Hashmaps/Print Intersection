Print Intersection
Send Feedback
You have been given two integer arrays/lists (ARR1 and ARR2) of size N and M, respectively. You need to print their intersection; An intersection for this problem can be defined when both the arrays/lists contain a particular value or to put it in other words, when there is a common value that exists in both the arrays/lists.
Note :
Input arrays/lists can contain duplicate elements.

The intersection elements printed would be in the order they appear in the second array/list (ARR2).


Input format :
The first line of input contains an integer 'N' representing the size of the first array/list.

The second line contains 'N' single space separated integers representing the elements of the first the array/list.

The third line contains an integer 'M' representing the size of the second array/list.

The fourth line contains 'M' single space separated integers representing the elements of the second array/list.
Output format :
Print the intersection elements. Each element is printed in a separate line.
Constraints :
0 <= N <= 10^6
0 <= M <= 10^6

Time Limit: 1 sec 
Sample Input 1 :
6
